                    </h2>
                    <p>Although they look a lot like a common housefly at first glance, mason bees are bees! Scientifically speaking, the Pacific Northwest variety that we dabble in is Osmia lignaria, 
                        but  they are commonly known as the Blue Orchard Mason Bee. Mason bees are unique from honey bees in that they do not have a queen or make honey.
                         In fact, outside of mating they live solitary lives. All females are born fertile and there are no worker bees. Instead of living in hives, mason bees live their solitary lives in holes!

                    <h2>Life Cycle
                        
                    </h2>

                    <p>The mason bee starts its life as an egg, which are laid between March and May. A single egg is laid in its own chamber, seperated from its sibling by a wall of mud. In the summer they hatch and become larva, gorging on the pollen supplies left by the female. They will then spin a cocoon and then enter their pupal stage. By late fall to early winter
                        the bees have fully metamorphosized into adults, still enveloped in their water tight cocoons. They will stay encased and hibernate until March or April.
                        Males will hatch a few weeks prior to the females and hang around the nesting holes until the females emerge. They will mate and then die.
                    </p>
                    <p>Females will spend the rest of their lives gathering pollen, mud, and laying eggs in holes until they die around the end of May. It's the females that live longer and do the bulk of the pollination!

                    <p>Honey bees have specialized structures called "pollen baskets" on their rear legs for gathering pollen in a deliberate manner. Mason bees, lacking this structure, are covered in a substantially greater amount fine hairs. In gathering pollen to deposit with each egg, mason bees will inadvertently cover themsleves in pollen and continue to deposit it in a sloppy, albeit efficient manner, at every flower they visit. Becuase of this, mason bees are actually 100 times more efficient pollinators than honey bees! The solitary nature of mason bees also makes them resistant to colony collapse disorder. </p>
                    <p>Over 85% of commerical honey bees in the United States are utilized for pollinating the nations almond crop, leaving little for other important crops and smaller farms who dont raise their own bees. The increasing threat of colony collapse has necessitated a source of more reliable pollination. Mason bees, being native to the Pacific Northwest, are now being leveraged as a viable and more natural means of pollination in hopes of lowering the cost of pollination and driving down food costs.  </p>
